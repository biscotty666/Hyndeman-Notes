# `tsibble` objects

```{r}
y <- tsibble(
  Year = 2015:2019,
  Observation = c(123, 39, 78, 52, 110),
  index = Year
)
```

```{r}
olympic_running
```

The 14 time series in this object are uniquely identified by the keys: the Length and Sex variables. The distinct() function can be used to show the categories of each variable or even combinations of variables:

```{r}
olympic_running |> distinct(Sex)
```

```{r}
PBS
```

This contains monthly data on Medicare Australia prescription data from July 1991 to June 2008. These are classified according to various concession types, and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) indexes. For this example, we are interested in the Cost time series (total cost of scripts in Australian dollars).

```{r}
PBS |>
  filter(ATC2 == "A10")
```

```{r}
PBS |>
  filter(ATC2 == "A10") |>
  select(Month, Concession, Type, Cost)
```

Note that the index variable Month, and the keys Concession and Type, would be returned even if they were not explicitly selected as they are required for a tsibble (to ensure each row contains a unique combination of keys and index).

```{r}
PBS |>
  filter(ATC2 == "A10") |>
  select(Month, Concession, Type, Cost) |>
  summarise(TotalC = sum(Cost))
```

```{r}
PBS |>
  filter(ATC2 == "A10") |>
  summarise(TotalC = sum(Cost)) |>
  mutate(Cost = TotalC / 1e6)
```

```{r}
PBS |>
  filter(ATC2 == "A10") |>
  select(Month, Concession, Type, Cost) |>
  summarise(TotalC = sum(Cost)) |>
  mutate(Cost = TotalC / 1e6) -> a10
```

## Reading Files

```{r}
prison <- readr::read_csv(("https://OTexts.com/fpp3/extrafiles/prison_population.csv"))
```

```{r}
prison
```

```{r}
 prison <- prison |>
  mutate(Quarter = yearquarter(Date)) |>
  select(-Date) |>
  as_tsibble(key=c(State, Gender, Legal, Indigenous),
             index = Quarter)
```

```{r}
prison
```

This tsibble contains 64 separate time series corresponding to the combinations of the 8 states, 2 genders, 2 legal statuses and 2 indigenous statuses. Each of these series is 48 observations in length, from 2005 Q1 to 2016 Q4.

For a tsibble to be valid, it requires a unique index for each combination of keys. The tsibble() or as_tsibble() function will return an error if this is not true.

# 2.2 Time Plots

```{r}
melsyd_economy <- ansett |>
  filter(Airports == "MEL-SYD", Class == "Economy") |>
  mutate(Passengers = Passengers/1000)
autoplot(melsyd_economy, Passengers) +
  labs(title = "Ansett airlines economy class",
       subtitle = "Melbourne-Sydney",
       y = "Passengers ('000)")
```

```{r}
autoplot(a10, Cost) +
  labs(y = "# (million)",
       title = "Australian antidiabetic drug sales")
```

Here, there is a clear and increasing trend. There is also a strong seasonal pattern that increases in size as the level of the series increases. The sudden drop at the start of each year is caused by a government subsidisation scheme that makes it cost-effective for patients to stockpile drugs at the end of the calendar year. Any forecasts of this series would need to capture the seasonal pattern, and the fact that the trend is changing slowly.

```{r}
a10 |>
  gg_season(Cost, labels = 'both') + 
  labs(y = "$ (millions)",
       title = "Seasonal plot: Antidiabetic drug sales")
```

A seasonal plot allows the underlying seasonal pattern to be seen more clearly, and is especially useful in identifying years in which the pattern changes.

## Multiple seasonal periods

Where the data has more than one seasonal pattern, the period argument can be used to select which seasonal plot is required. The vic_elec data contains half-hourly electricity demand for the state of Victoria, Australia. We can plot the daily pattern, weekly pattern or yearly pattern by specifying the period argument as shown in Figures 2.5â€“2.7.

In the first plot, the three days with 25 hours are when daylight saving ended in each year and so these days contained an extra hour. There were also three days with only 23 hours each (when daylight saving started) but these are hidden beneath all the other lines on the plot.

```{r}
vic_elec |> gg_season(Demand, period = "day") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(y="MWh", title = "Elecricity demand: Victoria")
```

```{r}
vic_elec |> gg_season(Demand, period = "week") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(y="MWh", title="Electricity demand: Victoria")
```

```{r}
vic_elec |> gg_season(Demand, period = "year") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(y="MWh", title="Electricity demand: Victoria")
```

```{r}
vic_elec |> gg_season(Demand, period = "month") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(y="MWh", title="Electricity demand: Victoria")
```

## Seasonal Subseries plots

An alternative plot that emphasises the seasonal patterns is where the data for each season are collected together in separate mini time plots.

```{r}
a10 |>
  gg_subseries(Cost) + 
  labs(y="$ million", title = "Subseries plot: antidiabetic drug sales")
```

The blue horizontal lines indicate the means for each month.

## Example: Australian holiday tourism

```{r}
holidays <- tourism |>
  filter(Purpose == "Holiday") |>
  group_by(State) |>
  summarise(Trips = sum(Trips))
holidays
```

```{r}
autoplot(holidays, Trips) +
  labs(y = "Overnight trips ('000)",
       title = "Australian domestic holidays")
  
```

```{r fig.height=14, fig.width=7}
gg_season(holidays, Trips) +
  labs(y = "Overnight Trips ('000)",
       title = "Australian domestic holidays")
```

## Subseries

```{r fig.height=12, fig.width=8}
holidays |>
  gg_subseries(Trips) +
  labs(y = "Overnight trips ('000)",
       title = "Australian domestic holidays")
```

## Scatterplots

Exploring relationships between time series

Figures [2.12](https://otexts.com/fpp3/scatterplots.html#fig:edemand) and [2.13](https://otexts.com/fpp3/scatterplots.html#fig:victemp) show two time series: half-hourly electricity demand (in Gigawatts) and temperature (in degrees Celsius), for 2014 in Victoria, Australia. The temperatures are for Melbourne, the largest city in Victoria, while the demand values are for the entire state.

```{r}
vic_elec |>
  filter(year(Time) == 2014) |>
  autoplot(Demand) +
  labs(y = "GW",
       title = "Half-hourly electricity demand: Victoria")
```

```{r}
vic_elec |>
  filter(year(Time) == 2014) |>
  autoplot(Temperature) +
  labs(y = "Degrees Celsius",
       title = "Half-hourly temperatures: Melbourne")
```

```{r}
vic_elec |>
  filter(year(Time) == 2014) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Temperature, y = Demand)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = 'Temperature (degrees Celsius)',
       y = "Electricity demand (GW)")
```

The plot shows a clear relationship when temperatures move above 25deg. Another, smaller effect, at colder temps.

The correlation coefficient only measures the strength of the *linear* relationship between two variables, and can sometimes be misleading. For example, the correlation for the electricity demand and temperature data shown in Figure [2.14](https://otexts.com/fpp3/scatterplots.html#fig:edemand2) is 0.28, but the *non-linear* relationship is stronger than that.

![Each of these plots has a correlation coefficient of 0.82. Data from Anscombe (1973).](https://otexts.com/fpp3/fpp_files/figure-html/anscombe-1.png)

Figure 2.16: Each of these plots has a correlation coefficient of 0.82. Data from Anscombe ([1973](https://otexts.com/fpp3/scatterplots.html#ref-Anscombe1973graphs)).

The plots in Figure [2.16](https://otexts.com/fpp3/scatterplots.html#fig:anscombe) all have correlation coefficients of 0.82, but they have very different relationships. This shows how important it is to look at the plots of the data and not simply rely on correlation values.

### Scatterplot matrices

When there are several potential predictor variables, it is useful to
plot each variable against each other variable. Consider the eight time
series shown in Figure [2.17](https://otexts.com/fpp3/scatterplots.html#fig:vntimeplots), showing quarterly visitor numbers across states and territories of Australia

```{r fig.height=9, fig.width=6}
visitors <- tourism |>
  group_by(State) |>
  summarise(Trips = sum(Trips))
visitors |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(vars(State), scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Australian domestic tourism",
       y = "Overnight trips ('000")
```

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height=12, fig.width=10}
visitors |>
  pivot_wider(values_from=Trips, names_from = State) |>
  GGally::ggpairs(columns = 2:9)
```

## Lag Plots

```{r}
recent_production <- aus_production |>
  filter(year(Quarter) >= 2000)
```

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
recent_production |>
  gg_lag(Beer, geom = "point") +
  labs(x = "lag(Beer, k)")
```

## Autocorrelation function (ACF)

```{r}
recent_production |> ACF(Beer, lag_max = 9)
```

```{r}
recent_production |> 
  ACF(Beer) |>
  autoplot() + labs(title = "Australian beer production")
```

### ACF plot showing trend and seasonality

```{r}
a10 |>
  ACF(Cost, lag_max = 48) |>
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "Australian beer production")
```

## White Noise

```{r}
set.seed(30)
y <- tsibble(sample = 1:50, wn = rnorm(50), index = sample)
y |> autoplot(wn) +
  labs(title = "White noise", y = "")
```

```{r}
y |> ACF(wn) |>
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "White noise", y = "")
```
